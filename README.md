A thin WPF wrapper around the WiiMote Lib (written by Brian Peek) intended to allow researchers to acquire data from the Wii Fit.  It collects raw data from the board and saves center of gravity coordinates to disk in an XML format.  It is also capable of exporting raw sensor values for those interested in generating custom analytics.

This software is released under the MIT license.
